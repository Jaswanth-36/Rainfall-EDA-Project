🌧 Rainfall Data Analysis for Agriculture (India)
📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Indian rainfall data to understand rainfall patterns and their impact on agriculture.

The analysis helps identify:

📈 Annual rainfall trends

🌦 Monthly rainfall distribution

🗺 Subdivision-wise rainfall comparison

🔥 Correlation between rainfall variables

📊 Rainfall distribution patterns

This project is useful for agriculture planning and climate-based decision making.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze historical rainfall data

Identify yearly rainfall trends

Study monthly rainfall variations

Compare rainfall across subdivisions

Visualize rainfall distribution for agricultural insights

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn
